# Ð¡reative Rotation

## Run

To run entire application with additional tools like database adminer use the command below

```bash
make run #runs components in containers using docker-compose
```

To run api and status_updater processes locally you can use the command below

```bash
make run-local #runs api and stats_updater processes on host machine
```

You can run both application components (API and Stats Updater) separately by using commands below

```bash
make run-api-local #runs http api on the host machine
make run-stats-updater-local #runs stats updater on the host machine
```

It's recommended to run Postgres and rabbitMQ in docker using the following command before launching api and
status_updater locally

```bash
make run-database-rabbit #runs api and stats_updater processes on host machine
```

## Test

```bash
make test-unit #runs unit tests
```

```bash
make run-integration-test #runs integration tests using docker containers
```

```bash
make test #runs all tests
```
